# Home Credit Default Risk
### Summary And Objective
Home Credit Group aims to enhance financial inclusion for individuals with limited or nonexistent credit histories. The challenge at hand is to leverage alternative data sources, such as telco and transactional information, more effectively to predict clients' repayment capabilities. Currently, Home Credit employs statistical and machine learning methods for these predictions, but they seek to maximize the utility of their data.

Predictive analysis involves using historical data to predict future events or outcomes. In the context of Home Credit's problem, predictive analysis can be used to forecast whether a customer can repay a loan. This is a fundamental aspect of credit risk assessment.

Classification algorithms are a type of predictive modeling technique used for categorizing data into different classes or groups. In this case, classification algorithms can be applied to classify loan applicants into categories such as "likely to repay" and "unlikely to repay.‚Äù 

The primary objective is to ensure that clients with the capacity to repay are not declined, and loans are structured with optimal principal amounts, maturities, and repayment schedules to empower clients toward financial success.
