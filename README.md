# Home Credit Default Risk
### Summary And Objective
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience.

In this notebook, we aim to explore the issue of credit default risk at Home Credit, a company that seeks to provide loans to individuals with insufficient or nonexistent credit histories. This underserved population often faces exploitation by unreliable lenders, making it crucial for Home Credit to ensure a positive and safe borrowing experience.

To address this challenge, Home Credit leverages various sources of alternative data, such as telecom and transactional information, to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
The primary objective is to ensure that clients with the capacity to repay are not declined, and loans are structured with optimal principal amounts, maturities, and repayment schedules to empower clients toward financial success.
